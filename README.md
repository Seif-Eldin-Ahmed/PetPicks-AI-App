# PetPicks-AI-App
##
##
### What is this project about:
This software classifies and differentiates between a dog and a cat using (**AI**) artificial intelligence.

#
### The idea of the project work:
The client runs the link and then the main interface (Home page) appears in front of him, in which he sees a form consisting of:
 - (Choose a file) button for uploading an image.
 - (Classify) button to classify an image you choose.
 - (Empty field) to show the result of the classification.

#
### What languages are we used:
- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
#
### What dataset are we using:
Kaggle - dataset - cats & dogs
#
### For Creating an AI model for our project we used (**TeachableMachine**) software.












1. We can add a **super user** with special permissions or add a **regular user** from the **_API_** or **_admin_** paths.
2. We can add new categories and financial transactions with specific users and fully control them from the **_API_** or **_admin_** paths.
3. We can control the type of fields that we generate for each user and each transaction.
4. Through the _**API**_ path we can get both:
   - Current transactions
   - Registered users
   - User-specific transactions
   - A Report that contains each user and all the transactions made by him
5. We can also _update_, _delete_, or _post_ a transaction through the _**API**_ and _**admin**_.

#
### What languages and tools are used in the project:
- Python
- Django 
- Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- HTML
- CSS

#
### What software we used for the testing:
Postman API platform

#
### Risks we faced in the project:
Work on connecting all users from the _admin_ path to the _API_ transactions, collecting user data(fields) and all his transactions, and adding them to a report.
